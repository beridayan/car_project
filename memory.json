    "concept": "adding numbers (+)",
    "explanation": "Addition means combining or putting together numbers to get a total. The symbol \"+\" means add. To add numbers, you count up from the first number by the amount of the second number. Examples:\n- 2 + 3 = 5 (start with 2, count up 3 more: 3, 4, 5)\n- 5 + 4 = 9 (start with 5, count up 4 more: 6, 7, 8, 9)\n- 10 + 15 = 25 (start with 10, add 15 more to get 25)\n- 100 + 100 = 200 (start with 100, add 100 more to get 200)\n\nThe basic rule is: first number + second number = total sum"
